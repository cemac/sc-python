title: "Variable Scope"
teaching: 5
exercises: 5
questions:
- "How do function calls actually work?"
- "How can I determine where errors occurred?"
objectives:
- "Identify local and global variables."
- "Identify parameters as local variables."
- "Read a traceback and determine the file, function, and line number on which the error occurred, the type of error, and the error message."
keypoints:
- "The scope of a variable is the part of a program that can 'see' that variable."

## The scope of a variable is the part of a program that can 'see' that variable.

*   There are only so many sensible names for variables.
*   People using functions shouldn't have to worry about
    what variable names the author of the function used.
*   People writing functions shouldn't have to worry about
    what variable names the function's caller uses.
*   The part of a program in which a variable is visible is called its *scope*.

~~~
pressure = 103.9

def adjust(t):
    temperature = t * 1.43 / pressure
    return temperature
~~~
{: .language-python}

*   `pressure` is a *global variable*.
    *   Defined outside any particular function.
    *   Visible everywhere.
*   `t` and `temperature` are *local variables* in `adjust`.
    *   Defined in the function.
    *   Not visible in the main program.
    *   Remember: a function parameter is a variable
        that is automatically assigned a value when the function is called.

~~~
print('adjusted:', adjust(0.9))
print('temperature after call:', temperature)

> ## Reading Error Messages
>
> Read the traceback below, and identify the following:
>
> 1. How many levels does the traceback have?
> 2. What is the file name where the error occurred?
> 3. What is the function name where the error occurred?
> 4. On which line number in this function did the error occur?
> 5. What is the type of error?
> 6. What is the error message?
