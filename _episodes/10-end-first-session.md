Before the next session, you may wish to consider:
* What sort of packages might you use in Python and why would you use them?
* How would data need to be formatted to be used in Pandas data frames? Would the data you have meet these requirements?
* What limitations or problems might you run into when thinking about how to apply what we've learned to your own projects or data?
