This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python for people with little or no previous 
programming experience. It uses plotting as its motivating example, and is designed to be used in 
both [Data Carpentry][dc-lessons] and [Software Carpentry][swc-lessons] workshops. 
This lesson references [JupyterLab][jupyter], but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter
as well. Please note that this lesson uses Python 3.
